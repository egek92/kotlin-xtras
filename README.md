Kotlin-Xtras
============

Extension functions for Kotlin. Most are additional functionality (or convenience) for the standard library & basic
types (e.g., List, String, etc.).

I'm primarily making this public for recruiters/devs looking at my GitHub, but contact me if you want to use any part of this (i'll add a license)
